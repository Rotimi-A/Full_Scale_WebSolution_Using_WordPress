# Full_Scale_WebSolution_Using_WordPress
In this project I will be preparing a storage infrastructure on two Linux servers and implementing a basic web solution using WordPress.

One server will be the web server and the other will be the database server.

We will:
1. Configure storage subsystem for Web and Database servers based on Linux OS (RedHat) on AWS. The focus of this part is to show us practical examples of working with disks, partitions and volumes in Linux.

2. Install WordPress and connect it to a remote MySQL database server. 

We will have the hands-on experience that showcases Three-tier Architecture while also ensuring that the disks used to store files on the Linux servers are adequately partitioned and managed through programs such as gdisk and LVM respectively.
